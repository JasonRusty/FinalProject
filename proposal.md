# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Shine Clicker! That or Melee Manufacturing
 
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A smash bros themed Idle clicking game, using pictures and sounds - a minimized offline version of cookie clicker themed to smash bros melee

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will run until the player gets the goal amount of clicks, the timer runs out, or the player exits the game. The game will feature gifs, audio, a user interface, background music, and animation on clicks. The software will keep track of the amount of times a gif (the shine) is clicked by the user, adding to the score. The score will be used as a currency to purchase other items in game which increase the score, with the goal to accumulate a high score within a short period of time. It will be executed using the turtle module, the random module, online resources including sounds and images from the smash bros video games. I will be coding in IDLE

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

GOOD OUTCOME: Useable game with sprites and audio. Implements the Timer module, Turtle module, score counter, has a UI with icons to click and interact with (one click equals one score, buying the items with clicks)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Same as the Good outcome, but the items will have flavor text describing them. The items will make noise upon purchase and in the background after purchase. Clicks per second will be calculated rather than in the background increasing the score. Animated icons in addition to a celebration screen.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The software will launch, displaying a simple UI. The score of the game will be the amount of clicks. Clicking the shine in the center will add to your clicks; you can spend these clicks on items that click automatically and add to your total. There are different tiers of items, each having a higher amount of clicks per second. Below the score, the clicks per second will display once items are bought. The items will be little gifs of the characters that have the 'shine' move, and they will make background noises. Lastly a timer will be in the top right corner. The goal is to get 10000 clicks in the shortest amount of time. The game will have a background image, background music, animated text, and ends with a little celebration screen showing your time and click count. Stretch goal - funny text will run at the bottom of the screen about your shine clicking journey ala cookie clicker. The shine image should "shake" and respond to a click from the user.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to research how to make elements of a UI respond to clicks. I will need to research how to make audio overlap in a way that doesn't make the user cringe. I will need to acquire the skill of time management and not doing everything at the last second to feel like a hero. I'll need to figure out how to calculate the clicks per second, as well as how to make the score count clicks and autoclicks simultaneously. I'll also need to figure out how to display animated gifs. I'll need to install GIMP to edit the opacity and other elements of the images, as well as change the file formats for usability in python. I'll also need to use the random module to display flavor text randomly from a list based on the amount of shines clicked
