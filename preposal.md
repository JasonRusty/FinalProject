# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I would like to make a limited version of the classic game, cookie clicker. I would make it smash bros themed, call it shine clicker. Add sounds, add autoclickers to buy after you accumulate enough clicks. It should be able to run automatically

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

No plans there.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Can we use web resources like images and sounds if we credit them?
