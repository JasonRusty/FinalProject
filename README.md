Shine Clicker! Version 1
Based on the hit game Cookie Clicker, Shine Clicker is a twist on the idle game format - rather than creating a cookie empire, you must click as many shine's as possible in 2 minutes!
Instructions:
Click the Shining Fox on Final Destination to get a point to your Shine Score.
Your Shine score can be spent on upgrades to your clicks, increasing your shine's per click.
A Multishine can be bought which passively adds Shine's per second to your total (Work in progress, more Multishiners coming soon)

The game will automatically close at the end of the timer and give you your score.
